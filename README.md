Metadata in JSON for monopoly

## Contributions
I freely borrowed (i.e., stole) the meta data for the game from [@danielstern](https://github.com/danielstern/science/blob/master/monopoly.json). I've taken his JSON file and manipulated it the way that I wanted it to look. Thanks to @danielstern for doing the hard work.
